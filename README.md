# Plotly_Deployment

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables. We will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
* Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
* Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
* Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
